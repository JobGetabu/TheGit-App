### 2. Build Variants 
Different flavors and builds of the same app sharing the same code base.
  
  according to @mladenrakonjac
  finalProduction - hits the playstore
  demoProduction - uses all new cool features -runs production server
  demoTesting - same as demoProduction but runs on test servers
  mock - good for designers and developers play around

### 3. ConstraintLayout
Use of the new performance efficient layout recommended for use by Google
offers better layering design and performance.

### 4. Data binding library
Kotlin provides data binding out of the box with some few changes in the gradle file.
This project specifically uses a binding-library..

### 5. MVVM architecture + repository pattern ( with mappers) + Android Manager Wrappers 

### 6. RxJava2 and how it helps us in architecture 

### 7. Dagger 2.11, what is Dependency Injection, why you should use it. 

### 8. Retrofit (with Rx Java2)

### 9. Room (with Rx Java2)
